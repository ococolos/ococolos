 Application is not meant to replace SAP, but to be complementary to it - it allows for a more in-detail view of the finished goods or subassemblies stocks. For example, in SAP you see the stock for a subassembly in its entirety; with the applications, you are able to see the input of production Team Leaders and have a separation between subassemblies being produced and the same parts already built and sent for further assembly in a finished good.

 # FLASK APPS
 
 ## Quality wall
 
 #### General info
  First application built for Eberspaecher. It allows for the quality department to monitor finished goods inspected at the Quality Wall - an inspection point separated from the production line, intended as a last line of defence for potential defects escaping to the customer. Application has its own user database with User and Admin roles. Good and Defective parts are scanned, with data logged for each particular user, making traceability possible in case of escapes. The application is checking whether the parts scanned belong to the same finished good part number and will signal if a part is from another type. This is achieved through a secondary communication with the IBM DB2 Database of MWA (internal traceability system), where it is checking the part number of that particular serial number. 
  Reports can be run to see defect breakdown by customer, by defect type. Reports for production can be run for each customer, outputting each part number and the number of parts inspected, along with user data for those parts.
